# FischerGourmet
For Fischer Gourmet, I designed and developed a website that would render a great user experience across all device types. I was responsible for UI design, interactions &amp; front-end development.  To design the new website for Fischer Gourmet, I listened to Private Chef Dan Fischer's vision and incorporated his core design elements.
